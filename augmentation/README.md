#  Data augmentation with Tailor for Natural Language Inference

We use Tailor to create perturbations used in data augmentation for NLI (Section 6 of the paper).

## Data

`filtered_swap_core.csv` contains the augmented examples generated by Tailor for the SNLI training dataset. These examples are created by perturbing original SNLI hypotheses with the SWAP\_CORE perturbation strategy and filtering generations by perplexity (threshold of -97.61211395263672) such that we retain the top 75% of generations in terms of fluency.

In our augmentation experiments, we treat original hypotheses as premises (field ``new_premise``) and perturbed hypotheses as hypotheses (field ``new_hypothesis``). For more details, see Section 6/Appendix E of the paper.
